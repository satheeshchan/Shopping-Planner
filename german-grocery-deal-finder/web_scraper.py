    # Analysis of the Aldi Süd site (manual observation):
    # The brochure (https://prospekt.aldi-sued.de/...) seems to be a dedicated viewer.
    # Looking at the network tab and page source:
    # - It loads a configuration JSON (e.g., .../blaetterkatalog_config.json). This config contains URLs to images.
    # - Page images are high-resolution JPEGs.
    # - Text is likely embedded within these images.
    #
    # This means that extracting text directly via BeautifulSoup from the main HTML of a page
    # will likely not yield product details. The primary target should be the image URLs.
    # The `blaetterkatalog_config.json` or similar configuration files are the key.

    # Example of what a more targeted approach might look for (pseudo-code):
    # 1. Fetch main brochure URL.
    # 2. Look for <script> tags or links that point to a ...config.json file.
    # 3. Fetch and parse this JSON file.
    # 4. Extract image URLs for each page from the JSON data.
    # These image URLs can then be passed to a multimodal AI.
    # The current scraper is generic and might find these images if they are in <img> tags,
    # but a targeted approach for this specific site would be more reliable.
